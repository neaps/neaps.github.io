The gulf\n        is very deep, with a narrow mouth to the Atlantic and sloping benthic\n        profile. As a result, the difference between high and low tides is\n        consistently 5 meters or more. Various websites and products we used had\n        different levels of accuracy when predicting the tides. We found one\n        that was just predicting tides from a station over 200km away, outside\n        the gulf, and therefore completely different in terms of water level and\n        timing.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The various surf or weather report apps either use old data, or base\n        large areas of coastline on one station.
